* Can we include print statements?
* Does matrix/vector indexing work? (Haven't tried)
* Why `nlminb` ?
* predict with new data?
* fit models with new data (other than with a closure)?
* watch out for internal state (when in doubt, rebuild objects)

* try out mvgauss with matrices
* try out mapping?
* make `MakeADFun` less noisy? (`silent`)
